f2-gui

Currently just a mock-up to show design intent for (f2)[https://github.com/aatango/f2] front-end.

Other than the not implemented features, the following are some of the current limitations of this prototype:
* Lines can duplicate eachother;
* Axis aren't responsive (if the main window is scaled large enough, the axis just stop);
