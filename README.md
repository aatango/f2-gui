f2-gui

Currently just a mock-up to show design intent for [f2](https://github.com/aatango/f2) front-end.

Other than the not implemented features, the following are some of the current limitations of this prototype:
* Lines can duplicate eachother;
* Axis aren't responsive (if the main window is scaled large enough, the axis just stop);

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot -->

## To-do
_Possible roadmap for this frontend._

* GUI representation of .f2g model;
* \+ .f2l loads;
* result files;
* create a new model from GUI;
* edit created/imported geometry; and
* edit created/imported loads.
